// process is running and able to accept and answer HTTP requests. Readiness —
// whether downstream dependencies such as the database are reachable — is a
// separate concern and will be exposed as its own endpoint once those
// dependencies exist. Keeping liveness dependency-free means an orchestrator
// will not kill a process that is healthy but waiting on a slow dependency.
